# Assemble from noise

*Raw signal → structured knowledge. What's the graph?*

## The exercise

Use the conversation you're in right now.

**Step 1: Listen for 3 minutes.** To whoever's talking nearby. Or use the last conversation you had tonight.

**Step 2: Extract entities.** Who was mentioned? What projects? What technologies? What claims were made? Write down every noun that carried information.

**Step 3: Extract relationships.** What connects the entities? "X built Y." "A competes with B." "C depends on D." "E thinks F is wrong about G." Every verb between two nouns is a candidate edge.

**Step 4: Draw the graph.** Entities are nodes. Relationships are labeled edges. You'll have maybe 5–15 nodes and 8–20 edges from a 3-minute conversation.

**Step 5: What's missing?** What did the speaker assume you already knew? Those implicit edges — the ones that weren't stated because they're "obvious" — are where the real knowledge lives. They're also where the real errors hide.

## What you'll notice

- Most of the information content is in the relationships, not the entities. Everyone in the conversation knows the nouns; the value is in how they're connected.
- The implicit edges vastly outnumber the explicit ones. A 3-minute conversation might state 10 relationships and assume 50.
- The same conversation, assembled by two different people, produces different graphs. The assembler's priors shape the extraction. This is Peirce's interpretant — the sense *you* made of the sign, which is different from the sense someone else would make.

## The Shannon connection

Of everything said in those 3 minutes, how much was information? Shannon says: only the parts that surprised you. The predictable parts — greetings, filler, things you already knew — carry zero bits. Your graph should capture the surprise, not the ceremony.

Calculate roughly: what percentage of the words spoken carried actual information content? Shannon estimated English is ~50% redundant. Casual conversation at a party is probably 70%+ redundant. The knowledge graph you drew is the compressed signal.
