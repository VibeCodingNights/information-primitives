# Who owns the ontology

---

Someone decided what the categories are. Someone decided what names they get. Someone decided which relationships are expressible and which aren't.

In a database, it's the schema designer. In a knowledge graph, it's whoever wrote the ontology. In a token standard, it's whoever wrote the EIP. In a conversation, it's whoever introduced the vocabulary that stuck.

Controlling the ontology is controlling what's thinkable within a system.

The Semantic Web promised universal ontologies — shared vocabularies that everyone would adopt, enabling interoperability across the entire web. What actually happened: competing standards, corporate capture, and fragmentation. The "universal" ontology is always someone's ontology with better marketing.

Peirce saw this coming. His "final interpretant" — the interpretation a community would converge on in the infinite long run — is a regulative ideal, not an achievable state. Every actual ontology is partial, provisional, and political.

**Gruber's definition:** An ontology is an explicit specification of a conceptualization. But whose conceptualization? The biologist and the chemist conceptualize a protein differently. The developer and the user conceptualize an "account" differently. The American and the European conceptualize "privacy" differently.

**The question:** When you merge two knowledge systems, the ontology conflict isn't a technical problem with a technical solution. It's a negotiation between worldviews. Who gets to decide the merged vocabulary? The bigger dataset? The more popular standard? The first mover? The person in the room with the most confidence?

And: If your agent builds its own ontology from the data it ingests — which increasingly they do — who owns *that*? The training data contributors? The model developer? The agent itself? Nobody?
