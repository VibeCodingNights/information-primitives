# Coordination as knowledge

---

When 500 people send the same message to a senator, that isn't 500 pieces of information. It's one piece of information — the message — plus one piece of coordination — the fact that 500 people organized to send it.

The coordination is more valuable than the content.

The senator's office already knows the arguments. What they don't know is whether the constituency is organized enough to act. The coordination signal — verified, structured, measurable — is the knowledge that changes decisions.

Most civic tech builds better megaphones. Louder messages, more reach, faster delivery. But the bottleneck isn't volume. Congressional offices receive 81 million messages a year. The bottleneck is signal: which messages represent organized constituencies vs. astroturfed campaigns vs. noise?

**The claim:** coordination *is* knowledge. Not a vehicle for knowledge. Not a means of distributing knowledge. The act of coordinating — proving that a community exists, is aligned, and can mobilize — is itself the information that matters.

If this is true, then the DIKW hierarchy is wrong. Data → information → knowledge → wisdom assumes knowledge is built from individual data points aggregated upward. But coordination knowledge doesn't aggregate from individual messages. It emerges from the structure of who sent them, when, and in what relationship to each other. It's a graph property, not a node property.

**The question:** What else is coordination-as-knowledge? What other domains have this structure where the act of organizing is more informative than the content being organized?
